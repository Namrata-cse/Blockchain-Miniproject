# Blockchain-Miniproject
Designing a blockchain based feedback system: A student will log in into the system and 
provide the feedback. Miner will collect the feedbacks and check correctness (validity 
of course code, session, instructor name, etc.). Miner will try to create block by 
solving the following puzzle:
Scrypt with memory size 100 and the hash operation x mod 131 with a given seed 
value randomly generated in a session.
